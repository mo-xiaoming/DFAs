In your match function, you're iterating over each character in the input string and each state in the current set of states. For each state, if the state's label matches the current character or is a ".", you're adding the epsilon-closure of the state's edge1 to the nexts set.

To handle negated character sets, you could modify this part of the function to check if the state's label is a negated character set and if the current character is not in this set. If both conditions are true, you would add the epsilon-closure of the state's edge1 to the nexts set.

Here's how you could modify your match function to handle negated character sets:

for c in string:
    for state in current:
        if state.label in (c, "."):
            nexts |= follow_epsilons(state.edge1)
        elif isinstance(state.label, NegatedCharacterSet) and c not in state.label:
            nexts |= follow_epsilons(state.edge1)
    current = nexts
    nexts = set()

In this code, NegatedCharacterSet would be a class that represents a negated character set. An instance of this class would contain the set of characters that are not matched by the negated character set. You would need to modify your thompsons_construction function to create instances of this class when it encounters a negated character set in the regular expression.


Grouping in regular expressions is typically handled at the parsing stage, rather than during the NFA construction or simulation.

In your shunting_yard function, you would handle opening and closing parentheses by treating them as special operators that affect the order of operations. When you encounter an opening parenthesis, you would push it onto the operator stack. When you encounter a closing parenthesis, you would pop operators from the stack and add them to the output until you encounter the corresponding opening parenthesis.

In your thompsons_construction function, you would handle parentheses by treating them as operators that construct a new NFA from the NFAs constructed from the regular expressions inside the parentheses. This would involve creating new start and accept states and connecting them to the start and accept states of the inner NFAs with epsilon transitions.

Here's a high-level description of how you could modify your thompsons_construction function to handle parentheses:

def thompsons_construction(postfix):
    stack = []

    for symbol in postfix:
        if symbol == '(':
            # Push a marker onto the stack to indicate the start of a group.
            stack.append('(')
        elif symbol == ')':
            # Pop NFAs from the stack until we reach the start of the group.
            group = []
            while stack[-1] != '(':
                group.append(stack.pop())
            # Remove the group start marker.
            stack.pop()
            # Construct a new NFA from the NFAs in the group.
            nfa = construct_group_nfa(group)
            # Push the new NFA onto the stack.
            stack.append(nfa)
        else:
            # Construct a new NFA from the symbol and push it onto the stack.
            nfa = construct_symbol_nfa(symbol)
            stack.append(nfa)

    # The final NFA is on top of the stack.
    return stack.pop()

In this code, construct_group_nfa is a function that constructs a new NFA from a group of NFAs, and construct_symbol_nfa is a function that constructs a new NFA from a symbol. You would need to implement these functions based on the specifics of your NFA representation.


Capturing groups in a regular expression engine can be handled by maintaining a stack of indices representing the start and end positions of each group in the input string.

Here's a high-level description of how you could modify your match function to handle capturing groups:

Initialization: Before the main loop, initialize an empty list or stack to hold the start and end positions of each group.

Group Start: When you encounter a state that represents the start of a group (you'll need to modify your thompsons_construction function to create such states), push the current position in the input string onto the stack.

Group End: When you encounter a state that represents the end of a group, pop the start position from the stack, and store the start and current positions as a tuple in a list of group positions.

Return: After the main loop, return the list of group positions along with the match result.

Here's how you could modify your match function to handle capturing groups:

def match(infix, string):
    infix = insert_concatenation_operators(infix)
    postfix = shunting_yard(infix)
    nfa = thompsons_construction(postfix)

    current = follow_epsilons(nfa.start)
    nexts = set()

    group_starts = []
    group_positions = []

    for i, c in enumerate(string):
        for state in current:
            if isinstance(state.label, GroupStart):
                group_starts.append(i)
            elif isinstance(state.label, GroupEnd):
                start = group_starts.pop()
                group_positions.append((start, i))
            elif state.label in (c, "."):
                nexts |= follow_epsilons(state.edge1)
        current = nexts
        nexts = set()

In this code, GroupStart and GroupEnd would be classes that represent the start and end of a group, respectively. You would need to modify your thompsons_construction function to create instances of these classes when it encounters parentheses in the regular expression.


Implementing backreferences in a regular expression engine can be quite complex, as it requires keeping track of the text matched by each capturing group and then being able to match that exact text later in the regular expression.

Here's a high-level description of how you could modify your match function to handle backreferences:

Initialization: Before the main loop, initialize an empty dictionary to hold the text matched by each group.

Group End: When you encounter a state that represents the end of a group, pop the start position from the stack, store the start and current positions as a tuple in a list of group positions, and store the matched text in the dictionary using the group number as the key.

Backreference: When you encounter a state that represents a backreference, check if the current position in the input string plus the length of the referenced group's text is less than the length of the input string, and if the substring of the input string starting at the current position and having the length of the referenced group's text is equal to the referenced group's text. If both conditions are true, add the state's edge1 to the nexts set.

Here's how you could modify your match function to handle backreferences:

def match(infix, string):
    infix = insert_concatenation_operators(infix)
    postfix = shunting_yard(infix)
    nfa = thompsons_construction(postfix)

    current = follow_epsilons(nfa.start)
    nexts = set()

    group_starts = []
    group_positions = []
    group_texts = {}

    for i, c in enumerate(string):
        for state in current:
            if isinstance(state.label, GroupStart):
                group_starts.append(i)
            elif isinstance(state.label, GroupEnd):
                start = group_starts.pop()
                end = i
                group_positions.append((start, end))
                group_texts[state.label.group_number] = string[start:end]
            elif isinstance(state.label, Backreference):
                ref_text = group_texts[state.label.group_number]
                if i + len(ref_text) <= len(string) and string[i:i+len(ref_text)] == ref_text:
                    nexts |= follow_epsilons(state.edge1)
            elif state.label in (c, "."):
                nexts |= follow_epsilons(state.edge1)
        current = nexts
        nexts = set()

    if nfa.accept in current:
        return True, group_positions

    # empty pattern matches empty string
    if not string and nfa.start == nfa.accept:
        return True, group_positions

    return False, group_positions

    if nfa.accept in current:
        return True, group_positions

    # empty pattern matches empty string
    if not string and nfa.start == nfa.accept:
        return True, group_positions

    return False, group_positions

In this code, GroupStart, GroupEnd, and Backreference would be classes that represent the start of a group, the end of a group, and a backreference, respectively. Each GroupEnd and Backreference instance would have a group_number attribute that specifies the number of the group it refers to. You would need to modify your thompsons_construction function to create instances of these classes when it encounters parentheses and backreferences in the regular expression.

Implementing lookahead assertions in a regular expression engine can be quite complex, as it requires checking if a certain pattern matches or doesn't match at the current position in the input string without consuming any characters.

Here's a high-level description of how you could modify your match function to handle lookahead assertions:

Lookahead Assertion: When you encounter a state that represents a lookahead assertion, simulate the NFA constructed from the assertion's pattern on the substring of the input string starting at the current position. If the simulation result matches the assertion's type (positive or negative), add the state's edge1 to the nexts set.
Here's how you could modify your match function to handle lookahead assertions:

def match(infix, string):
    infix = insert_concatenation_operators(infix)
    postfix = shunting_yard(infix)
    nfa = thompsons_construction(postfix)

    current = follow_epsilons(nfa.start)
    nexts = set()

    for i, c in enumerate(string):
        for state in current:
            if isinstance(state.label, LookaheadAssertion):
                result, _ = match(state.label.pattern, string[i:])
                if (state.label.positive and result) or (not state.label.positive and not result):
                    nexts |= follow_epsilons(state.edge1)
            elif state.label in (c, "."):
                nexts |= follow_epsilons(state.edge1)
        current = nexts
        nexts = set()

    if nfa.accept in current:
        return True

    # empty pattern matches empty string
    if not string and nfa.start == nfa.accept:
        return True

    return False

In this code, LookaheadAssertion would be a class that represents a lookahead assertion. An instance of this class would have a pattern attribute that specifies the pattern of the assertion and a positive attribute that specifies whether the assertion is positive or negative. You would need to modify your thompsons_construction function to create instances of this class when it encounters lookahead assertions in the regular expression.

Implementing lookbehind assertions in a regular expression engine can be quite complex, as it requires checking if a certain pattern matches or doesn't match before the current position in the input string without consuming any characters.

Here's a high-level description of how you could modify your match function to handle lookbehind assertions:

Lookbehind Assertion: When you encounter a state that represents a lookbehind assertion, simulate the NFA constructed from the assertion's pattern on the substring of the input string ending at the current position. If the simulation result matches the assertion's type (positive or negative), add the state's edge1 to the nexts set.
Here's how you could modify your match function to handle lookbehind assertions:

def match(infix, string):
    infix = insert_concatenation_operators(infix)
    postfix = shunting_yard(infix)
    nfa = thompsons_construction(postfix)

    current = follow_epsilons(nfa.start)
    nexts = set()

    for i, c in enumerate(string):
        for state in current:
            if isinstance(state.label, LookbehindAssertion):
                result, _ = match(state.label.pattern, string[:i])
                if (state.label.positive and result) or (not state.label.positive and not result):
                    nexts |= follow_epsilons(state.edge1)
            elif state.label in (c, "."):
                nexts |= follow_epsilons(state.edge1)
        current = nexts
        nexts = set()

    if nfa.accept in current:
        return True

    # empty pattern matches empty string
    if not string and nfa.start == nfa.accept:
        return True

    return False

In this code, LookbehindAssertion would be a class that represents a lookbehind assertion. An instance of this class would have a pattern attribute that specifies the pattern of the assertion and a positive attribute that specifies whether the assertion is positive or negative. You would need to modify your thompsons_construction function to create instances of this class when it encounters lookbehind assertions in the regular expression.

Implementing non-greedy (or lazy) matching in a regular expression engine can be quite complex, as it requires changing the order in which the engine explores the possible matches.

In a greedy engine, when the engine encounters a quantifier (like *, +, or ?), it tries to consume as many characters as possible. In a non-greedy (or lazy) engine, it tries to consume as few characters as possible.

To implement non-greedy matching, you would need to modify your match function to explore the possible matches in a different order. Instead of immediately following the edge1 of a state when the state's label matches the current character, you would first add the state's edge1 to the nexts set and then continue with the other states in the current set. Only after you have processed all the states in the current set would you follow the edge1 of the states.

Here's how you could modify your match function to implement non-greedy matching:

def match(infix, string):
    infix = insert_concatenation_operators(infix)
    postfix = shunting_yard(infix)
    nfa = thompsons_construction(postfix)

    current = follow_epsilons(nfa.start)
    nexts = set()

    for c in string:
        for state in current:
            if state.label in (c, "."):
                nexts |= follow_epsilons(state.edge1)
        current = nexts | current
        nexts = set()

    if nfa.accept in current:
        return True

    # empty pattern matches empty string
    if not string and nfa.start == nfa.accept:
        return True

    return False

In this code, the line current = nexts | current ensures that the engine first tries to match the remaining characters with the states in the current set before following the edge1 of the states.
